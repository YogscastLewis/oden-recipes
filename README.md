# oden-recipes
Beginner project to create a recipe website.
This project was created on the 18 of November, 2024

I am currently 43% of the way through the Odin projects introductory course, with very minimal coding experience since beforehand.

I am testing my abilities to use Git and Github, and to commit and write correct commit messages.
I am also testing my abilities to code in HTML, and to lay the groundworks of a website, with several pages, links, images and lists.
